## Mancala Environment with Reinforcement Learning Bolt-On
This repo contains code related to simulating a game of Mancala, including a more advanced implementation of Q-learning that uses softmax + epsilon-greedy with epsilon and alpha decay. Every branch contains a specific person's adjustment to the baseline code (with the new reward system); please see the Contributions section (section 7) of our report to determine which branches correspond to which person. The master branch contains our final model, all figures/plots related to it, and our slides from the presentation.
